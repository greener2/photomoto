A photo storage and upload app, that allows you to create albums of photos, tag photos and share photos securely. The 
nice thing is that all metadata is stripped out by default, and this will be configurable based on the user's 
preference.

The idea is that this might be a lightweight replacement for Google photos, but with a lot less features planned, I 
guess!
